![](yogapicture.png)


The objective of this project is to create a model capable to recognize an asana (yoga pose) and identify its name. The model has been trained with more than 5000 pictures of 5 distinct yoga poses (downdog, plank, tree, goddes & warrior2) and the main tools used for this project are tensorflow (autotune) and keras (dense, sequential, model checkpoint...)
